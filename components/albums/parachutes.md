Coldplay’s debut album is the musical equivalent of a warm hug from an old friend. Warm and autumny, the soft acoustic guitars and Jonny’s fuzzy Tele, backed up by Guy’s bass and Will’s drums, with Chris’ endearing falsetto vocals give this album a very soft, cosy feeling.

The opening track of the album, "Don't Panic" gets its name from the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy slogan, and sets the tone of everything with the weird melancholic atmosphere. “All of us are done for” and yet “We live in a beautiful world” sings Chris, and it’s very true. Might as well huddle together round a campfire singing if the world is so harsh out there.

A rather sad song about unrequited love, "Shiver" is a very good singalong song. Will really lets loose on the drums here, with Jonny doing his multiple-layers-of-guitar thing to make the whole song sound a bit like biting into a Polo on a crisp cold day.

"Spies" is a very odd track, beginning with a foreboding acoustic guitar strum, and building up into a jangly slightly wild song that showcases Will’s drumming. Guy’s bass line is also noticeable here, though maybe not as much as later. The bridge also has Coldplay showing off all of their background vocals for the first time, combined with a weird staccato guitar riff from Jonny that builds up into a very tense bridge, before slowly fading out again, whispering that “They’re just spies”

Once a deep cut, now popularized thanks to Tiktok, "Sparks" is a acoustic guitar at a campfire song. Earnest and nervous and heartfelt and warm, it’s a quintessential Coldplay love song, with Chris promising that he’ll "always look out for you". It’s a tribute to how well the band members blend together: at first glance it seems like it’s just an acoustic track, but listen closely and you can hear everyone’s contribution combining to make this song the cohesive whole it is, from the soft hi-hat, to the warm bass, to the chiming guitar.

The musical equivalent of a lazy smile "Yellow" also feels like leaping out into the universe. It’s impossible not to love Yellow and easy to see why this song made Coldplay famous almost overnight. It’s a song about being in love being played by a band that is utterly and completely enjoying what they are doing. Jonny’s iconic riff is as fun to play as it is to listen to, and Chris puts so much heartfelt emotion into his vocals, he makes you believe that the stars are, in fact, shining for you.

A Coldplay staple now, "Trouble" opens with an iconic piano intro and Chris’s vocals, before leading into a fully fleshed out song. With spiderweb analogies, and apologetic lyrics, it’s a rather sombre song, but still fitting into the atmosphere of Parachutes, and in typical Coldplay style, manages to retain its warmth.

Having a title track that’s just 46 seconds long is an odd choice I suppose, but somehow "Parachutes", an endearing little track that’s just sliding guitar and Chris Martin’s voice sticks with you for longer than it should. It’s a nice little sample package of the cosiness of the album combined with the angst of the 2000s.

A track that (possibly justifiably) earned Coldplay many more Radiohead comparisons, "High Speed" is perhaps the least cosy of all the songs on the album. What it lacks in comfort however, it makes up in tightness of sound. You can hear the whole band playing together on the track, fitting in with each other smoothly as an outfit, giving the whole song a very nice flow.

Another oddly endearing track, "We Never Change" is a wistful, wry, mostly-acoustic-guitar ballad. Why does Chris Martin want to live in a wooden house? We may never know, and yet when he sings it, it feels as if we understand him perfectly. Jonny’s guitar couldn’t sound more like a lazy drawl than it does here.

The first of a long line of closing song anthems, which would go on to become Coldplay’s trademark, "Everything’s Not Lost" sums the whole album up, and Coldplay as well really, with the idea that, sure, things aren’t great rn, but hey, they’re not too bad, all things considered. The final “Oh, oh, yeah” seems deliberately included to get people to sing along. "Life is for Living" is also popped into this as a hidden track, which is sweet
